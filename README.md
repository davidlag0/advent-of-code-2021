This year (2021), I'm learning Rust! As I go through Advent of Code, I will attempt the challenges on my own and then improve it by looking at other people's code.

## Usage

### Solve puzzles
`$ cargo run <path to folder with input files>`

### Run tests in current environment
`$ cargo test -- --nocapture`
